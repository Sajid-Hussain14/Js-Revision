<!-- //closure--gives access to outer function from an inner function
//lexical sxoping -- scope within functions  ------ 
Lexical scope refers to how variable scope is determined in JavaScript. Specifically, it defines the region of a program in which a variable is accessible based on where it is physically declared (in the source code). Lexical scope is determined at the time the code is written, not at runtime.
